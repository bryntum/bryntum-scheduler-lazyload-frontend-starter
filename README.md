# Bryntum Scheduler LazyLoad frontend starter

This repository holds the Bryntum Scheduler application to demonstrate how to use the lazy load feature available for the Bryntum Scheduler from version 6.

## Getting Started

Install the Vite dev dependency by running the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

Now install the Bryntum scheduler component using npm. First, get access to the Bryntum private npm registry by following this guide in our docs: [Access to npm registry](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/quick-start/javascript-npm#access-to-npm-registry). Once youâ€™ve logged in to the registry, [install the Bryntum Scheduler component](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/quick-start/javascript-npm#install-component). Make sure that you install version 6 or higher as the LazyLoad feature that we'll use was released in version 6.

Run the local development server for the Bryntum scheduler app using the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
