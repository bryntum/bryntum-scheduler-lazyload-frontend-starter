# Bryntum Scheduler lazyLoad frontend starter

This repository holds the Bryntum Scheduler application to demonstrate how to use the lazyLoad feature available for the Bryntum Scheduler from Version 6.

## Getting started

Install the Vite dev dependency by running the following command:

```shell
npm install
```

Now install the Bryntum Scheduler component using npm. First, get access to the Bryntum private npm registry by following the [guide in our docs](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/quick-start/javascript-npm#access-to-npm-registry). Once youâ€™ve logged in to the registry, [install the Bryntum Scheduler component](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/docs/guide/Scheduler/quick-start/javascript-npm#install-component). Make sure you install Version 6 or higher as the lazyLoad feature we'll use was released in Version 6.

Run the local development server for the Bryntum Scheduler app using the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/).
